# Culture Amp's Elm 0.18-to-0.19 API shims (WIP)

# ARCHIVED

At this point nobody should be using Elm 0.18. And so this library is unnecessary - if you used this to upgrade to Elm 0.19, you can now use the Elm 0.19 paths directly.

The code for this library can still be used via NPM but no further updates here will be made.

This is a workspace for developing shims for dropping into an Elm 0.18 codebase to mimic the 0.19 APIs and prepare for a speedy upgrade. This project was inspired by the upgrade process being undertaken at [NoRedInk](https://github.com/NoRedInk), as described in this episode of [Elm Town](https://elmtown.audio/upgrading-to-elm-019-luke-westby-richard-feldman)!

`yarn test` copies and unshims the example Elm app from the Elm 0.18 workspace to the Elm 0.19 workspace, then makes both projects with their respective compilers.

Happy upgrading!
