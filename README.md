# Culture Amp's Elm 0.18-to-0.19 API shims (WIP)

[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

This is a workspace for developing shims for dropping into an Elm 0.18 codebase to mimic the 0.19 APIs and prepare for a speedy upgrade. This project was inspired by the upgrade process being undertaken at [NoRedInk](https://github.com/NoRedInk), as described in this episode of [Elm Town](https://elmtown.audio/upgrading-to-elm-019-luke-westby-richard-feldman)!

`yarn test` copies and unshims the example Elm app from the Elm 0.18 workspace to the Elm 0.19 workspace, then makes both projects with their respective compilers.

Happy upgrading!
